# Blackjackgame
This is a Black Jack game built using Ruby
This game is fairly simple.
You will notice that two cards are displayed in the middle of the screen, a number on the 
top left side of the screen and two buttons on either side of the lower half of the screen. Depending
on the score, the player, you, will have the ability to continue by clicking on the 'hit' button
or try your luck against the randomizer that is the dealer when you click the 'stay' button.

I seem to have deleted my skeleton for the Ruby game, or I might not have made any commits to it (which
is the more plausible explanation, as I did not get around to using Git until about two weeks
ago). The only copy of my game in Ruby is the completed, finished one. 

Everything works well but not perfectly. The game can still continue once it is finished by 
continuing to click the buttons at the bottom of the screen. The card graphics are limited to
two and they do not contain any indicator as to which specific card it is. I plan on modifying 
my game during spring break to make these corrections.

The image was grabbed from Bing's search engine, and I was able to track it back to an amazon
online retailer and a webstie, partytimesrus.com, which both sold the same blackjack table felt.
I could not find a section that said I could not use the image from the websites. I believe 
this is okay as long as I do not use the image for any nefarious means or try to sell my game
with their image as its background.
